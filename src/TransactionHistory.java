public class TransactionHistory {
    //Used to track the customer's ATM usage by storing information related to each transaction via the main menu; all customer transactions (including both A and S transactions, as described in the Program Functionality section) should be logged.
    //This transaction history should be viewable via the main menu (as an option) at any time.
    //There only needs to be one TransactionHistory object in the program, and there should be methods to get the history, add a transaction to the history, etc.
    //It is up to you whether you want to capture the user's history as a single string that you append onto, an array that you resize each time a new transaction is added, or an ArrayList -- which we haven't learned yet but you could research and figure out.
